# MacroChainGoneWild

loopty loo

```
Allows for a macro to continue onto the next macro by using '/nextmacro' on the last line of a macro.
Adding '/nextmacro' on the last line of Macro #01 will automatically execute Macro #02
Adding '/nextmacro down' on the last line of Macro #01 will automatically execute Macro #11
Adding '/nextmacro loop' on the last line of a macro will loop that macro until another macro is run.
Also allows executing any macro from chat using '/runmacro'. This also works from within another macro.
